<p>
The incapacity of a weak and distracted government may often assume the
appearance, and produce the effects, of a treasonable correspondence
with the public enemy. If Alaric himself had been introduced into the
council of Ravenna, he would probably have advised the same measures
which were actually pursued by the ministers of Honorius. <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> The king
of the Goths would have conspired, perhaps with some reluctance, to
destroy the formidable adversary, by whose arms, in Italy, as well as in
Greece, he had been twice overthrown. Their active and interested hatred
laboriously accomplished the disgrace and ruin of the great Stilicho.
The valor of Sarus, his fame in arms, and his personal, or hereditary,
influence over the confederate Barbarians, could recommend him only to
the friends of their country, who despised, or detested, the worthless
characters of Turpilio, Varanes, and Vigilantius. By the pressing
instances of the new favorites, these generals, unworthy as they had
shown themselves of the names of soldiers, <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> were promoted to the
command of the cavalry, of the infantry, and of the domestic troops. The
Gothic prince would have subscribed with pleasure the edict which
the fanaticism of Olympius dictated to the simple and devout emperor.
Honorius excluded all persons, who were adverse to the Catholic church,
from holding any office in the state; obstinately rejected the service
of all those who dissented from his religion; and rashly disqualified
many of his bravest and most skilful officers, who adhered to the
Pagan worship, or who had imbibed the opinions of Arianism. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> These
measures, so advantageous to an enemy, Alaric would have approved, and
might perhaps have suggested; but it may seem doubtful, whether the
Barbarian would have promoted his interest at the expense of the inhuman
and absurd cruelty which was perpetrated by the direction, or at least
with the connivance of the Imperial ministers. The foreign auxiliaries,
who had been attached to the person of Stilicho, lamented his death;
but the desire of revenge was checked by a natural apprehension for the
safety of their wives and children; who were detained as hostages in
the strong cities of Italy, where they had likewise deposited their most
valuable effects. At the same hour, and as if by a common signal, the
cities of Italy were polluted by the same horrid scenes of universal
massacre and pillage, which involved, in promiscuous destruction, the
families and fortunes of the Barbarians. Exasperated by such an injury,
which might have awakened the tamest and most servile spirit, they
cast a look of indignation and hope towards the camp of Alaric,
and unanimously swore to pursue, with just and implacable war, the
perfidious nation who had so basely violated the laws of hospitality.
By the imprudent conduct of the ministers of Honorius, the republic
lost the assistance, and deserved the enmity, of thirty thousand of her
bravest soldiers; and the weight of that formidable army, which alone
might have determined the event of the war, was transferred from the
scale of the Romans into that of the Goths.

<p>
In the arts of negotiation, as well as in those of war, the Gothic king
maintained his superior ascendant over an enemy, whose seeming changes
proceeded from the total want of counsel and design. From his camp, on
the confines of Italy, Alaric attentively observed the revolutions of
the palace, watched the progress of faction and discontent, disguised
the hostile aspect of a Barbarian invader, and assumed the more popular
appearance of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho: to whose
virtues, when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a just
tribute of sincere praise and regret. The pressing invitation of the
malecontents, who urged the king of the Goths to invade Italy, was
enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries; and he might
especially complain, that the Imperial ministers still delayed and
eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds of gold which had been
granted by the Roman senate, either to reward his services, or to
appease his fury. His decent firmness was supported by an artful
moderation, which contributed to the success of his designs. He
required a fair and reasonable satisfaction; but he gave the strongest
assurances, that, as soon as he had obtained it, he would immediately
retire. He refused to trust the faith of the Romans, unless Aetius and
Jason, the sons of two great officers of state, were sent as hostages to
his camp; but he offered to deliver, in exchange, several of the noblest
youths of the Gothic nation. The modesty of Alaric was interpreted, by
the ministers of Ravenna, as a sure evidence of his weakness and fear.
They disdained either to negotiate a treaty, or to assemble an army; and
with a rash confidence, derived only from their ignorance of the extreme
danger, irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war.
While they expected, in sullen silence, that the Barbarians would
evacuate the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid marches,
passed the Alps and the Po; hastily pillaged the cities of Aquileia,
Altinum, Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to his arms; increased
his forces by the accession of thirty thousand auxiliaries; and, without
meeting a single enemy in the field, advanced as far as the edge of the
morass which protected the impregnable residence of the emperor of the
West. Instead of attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna, the prudent
leader of the Goths proceeded to Rimini, stretched his ravages along the
sea-coast of the Hadriatic, and meditated the conquest of the ancient
mistress of the world. An Italian hermit, whose zeal and sanctity were
respected by the Barbarians themselves, encountered the victorious
monarch, and boldly denounced the indignation of Heaven against the
oppressors of the earth; but the saint himself was confounded by the
solemn asseveration of Alaric, that he felt a secret and praeternatural
impulse, which directed, and even compelled, his march to the gates of
Rome. He felt, that his genius and his fortune were equal to the most
arduous enterprises; and the enthusiasm which he communicated to
the Goths, insensibly removed the popular, and almost superstitious,
reverence of the nations for the majesty of the Roman name. His troops,
animated by the hopes of spoil, followed the course of the Flaminian
way, occupied the unguarded passes of the Apennine, <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> descended into
the rich plains of Umbria; and, as they lay encamped on the banks of
the Clitumnus, might wantonly slaughter and devour the milk-white oxen,
which had been so long reserved for the use of Roman triumphs. A
lofty situation, and a seasonable tempest of thunder and lightning,
preserved the little city of Narni; but the king of the Goths, despising
the ignoble prey, still advanced with unabated vigor; and after he had
passed through the stately arches, adorned with the spoils of Barbaric
victories, he pitched his camp under the walls of Rome. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a>

[ Addison (see his Works, vol. ii. p. 54, edit. Baskerville)
has given a very picturesque description of the road through the
Apennine. The Goths were not at leisure to observe the beauties of
the prospect; but they were pleased to find that the Saxa Intercisa, a
narrow passage which Vespasian had cut through the rock, (Cluver. Italia
Antiq. tom. i. p. 168,) was totally neglected.

[ Some ideas of the march of Alaric are borrowed from the
journey of Honorius over the same ground. (See Claudian in vi. Cons.
Hon. 494-522.) The measured distance between Ravenna and Rome was
254 Roman miles. Itinerar. Wesseling, p. 126.] 
</p>
<p>
During a period of six
hundred and nineteen years, the seat of empire had never been violated
by the presence of a foreign enemy. The unsuccessful expedition of
Hannibal <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> served only to display the character of the senate and
people; of a senate degraded, rather than ennobled, by the comparison of
an assembly of kings; and of a people, to whom the ambassador of Pyrrhus
ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the Hydra. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> Each of the
senators, in the time of the Punic war, had accomplished his term of the
military service, either in a subordinate or a superior station; and
the decree, which invested with temporary command all those who had
been consuls, or censors, or dictators, gave the republic the immediate
assistance of many brave and experienced generals. In the beginning of
the war, the Roman people consisted of two hundred and fifty thousand
citizens of an age to bear arms. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> Fifty thousand had already died in
the defence of their country; and the twenty-three legions which were
employed in the different camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, and
Spain, required about one hundred thousand men. But there still remained
an equal number in Rome, and the adjacent territory, who were animated
by the same intrepid courage; and every citizen was trained, from his
earliest youth, in the discipline and exercises of a soldier. Hannibal
was astonished by the constancy of the senate, who, without raising
the siege of Capua, or recalling their scattered forces, expected his
approach. He encamped on the banks of the Anio, at the distance of three
miles from the city; and he was soon informed, that the ground on which
he had pitched his tent, was sold for an adequate price at a public
auction; <a href="#note-911" name="noteref-911"><small>911</small></a> and that a body of troops was dismissed by an opposite
road, to reenforce the legions of Spain. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> He led his Africans to the
gates of Rome, where he found three armies in order of battle, prepared
to receive him; but Hannibal dreaded the event of a combat, from
which he could not hope to escape, unless he destroyed the last of his
enemies; and his speedy retreat confessed the invincible courage of the
Romans.

[ In the three census which were made of the Roman people,

(see Livy, Epitom. l. xx. Hist. l. xxvii. 36. xxix. 37:) 270,213,
137,108 214,000. The fall of the second, and the rise of the third,
appears so enormous, that several critics, notwithstanding the unanimity
of the Mss., have suspected some corruption of the text of Livy. (See
Drakenborch ad xxvii. 36, and Beaufort, Republique Romaine, tom. i. p.
325.) They did not consider that the second census was taken only at
Rome, and that the numbers were diminished, not only by the death, but
likewise by the absence, of many soldiers. In the third census, Livy
expressly affirms, that the legions were mustered by the care of
particular commissaries. From the numbers on the list we must always
deduct one twelfth above threescore, and incapable of bearing arms. See
Population de la France, p. 72.]

</p>
<p>
From the time of the Punic war, the uninterrupted succession of senators
had preserved the name and image of the republic; and the degenerate
subjects of Honorius ambitiously derived their descent from the heroes
who had repulsed the arms of Hannibal, and subdued the nations of the
earth. The temporal honors which the devout Paula <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> inherited
and despised, are carefully recapitulated by Jerom, the guide of her
conscience, and the historian of her life. The genealogy of her father,
Rogatus, which ascended as high as Agamemnon, might seem to betray
a Grecian origin; but her mother, Blaesilla, numbered the Scipios,
Aemilius Paulus, and the Gracchi, in the list of her ancestors; and
Toxotius, the husband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas,
the father of the Julian line. The vanity of the rich, who desired to
be noble, was gratified by these lofty pretensions. Encouraged by the
applause of their parasites, they easily imposed on the credulity of
the vulgar; and were countenanced, in some measure, by the custom of
adopting the name of their patron, which had always prevailed among the
freedmen and clients of illustrious families. Most of those families,
however, attacked by so many causes of external violence or internal
decay, were gradually extirpated; and it would be more reasonable to
seek for a lineal descent of twenty generations, among the mountains of
the Alps, or in the peaceful solitude of Apulia, than on the theatre
of Rome, the seat of fortune, of danger, and of perpetual revolutions.
Under each successive reign, and from every province of the empire, a
crowd of hardy adventurers, rising to eminence by their talents or their
vices, usurped the wealth, the honors, and the palaces of Rome; and
oppressed, or protected, the poor and humble remains of consular
families; who were ignorant, perhaps, of the glory of their ancestors.

solid title than the surname of Julius, which Toxotius shared with a
thousand families of the western provinces. See the Index of Tacitus, of

[ Tacitus (Annal. iii. 55) affirms, that between the battle
of Actium and the reign of Vespasian, the senate was gradually filled
with new families from the Municipia and colonies of Italy.]
</p>
<p>
In the time of Jerom and Claudian, the senators unanimously yielded the
preeminence to the Anician line; and a slight view of their history will
serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the noble families, which
contended only for the second place. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> During the five first ages
of the city, the name of the Anicians was unknown; they appear to have
derived their origin from Praeneste; and the ambition of those new
citizens was long satisfied with the Plebeian honors of tribunes of
the people. <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> One hundred and sixty-eight years before the Christian
aera, the family was ennobled by the Praetorship of Anicius, who
gloriously terminated the Illyrian war, by the conquest of the nation,
and the captivity of their king. <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> From the triumph of that general,
three consulships, in distant periods, mark the succession of the
Anician name. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> From the reign of Diocletian to the final extinction
of the Western empire, that name shone with a lustre which was not
eclipsed, in the public estimation, by the majesty of the Imperial
purple. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> The several branches, to whom it was communicated, united,
by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and titles of the Annian, the
Petronian, and the Olybrian houses; and in each generation the number
of consulships was multiplied by an hereditary claim. <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> The Anician
family excelled in faith and in riches: they were the first of the
Roman senate who embraced Christianity; and it is probable that Anicius
Julian, who was afterwards consul and praefect of the city, atoned for
his attachment to the party of Maxentius, by the readiness with which
he accepted the religion of Constantine. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> Their ample patrimony was
increased by the industry of Probus, the chief of the Anician family;
who shared with Gratian the honors of the consulship, and exercised,
four times, the high office of Praetorian praefect. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> His immense
estates were scattered over the wide extent of the Roman world; and
though the public might suspect or disapprove the methods by which they
had been acquired, the generosity and magnificence of that fortunate
statesman deserved the gratitude of his clients, and the admiration of
strangers. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> Such was the respect entertained for his memory, that
the two sons of Probus, in their earliest youth, and at the request
of the senate, were associated in the consular dignity; a memorable
distinction, without example, in the annals of Rome. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
"The marbles of the Anician palace," were used as a proverbial
expression of opulence and splendor; <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> but the nobles and senators of
Rome aspired, in due gradation, to imitate that illustrious family. The
accurate description of the city, which was composed in the Theodosian
age, enumerates one thousand seven hundred and eighty houses, the
residence of wealthy and honorable citizens. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> Many of these stately
mansions might almost excuse the exaggeration of the poet; that Rome
contained a multitude of palaces, and that each palace was equal to a
city: since it included within its own precincts every thing which could
be subservient either to use or luxury; markets, hippodromes, temples,
fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial aviaries. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a>
The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state of Rome when it was
besieged by the Goths, <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> continues to observe, that several of the
richest senators received from their estates an annual income of four
thousand pounds of gold, above one hundred and sixty thousand pounds
sterling; without computing the stated provision of corn and wine,
which, had they been sold, might have equalled in value one third of
the money. Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of
a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds of gold might be considered as no
more than adequate to the dignity of the senatorian rank, which required
many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind. Several examples
are recorded, in the age of Honorius, of vain and popular nobles, who
celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival, which lasted
seven days, and cost above one hundred thousand pounds sterling. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a>
The estates of the Roman senators, which so far exceeded the proportion
of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of Italy. Their
possessions extended far beyond the Ionian and Aegean Seas, to the most
distant provinces: the city of Nicopolis, which Augustus had founded
as an eternal monument of the Actian victory, was the property of the
devout Paula; <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers, which
had divided hostile nations, now flowed through the lands of private
citizens. <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> According to their temper and circumstances, the estates
of the Romans were either cultivated by the labor of their slaves, or
granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to the industrious farmer.
The economical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former
method, wherever it may be practicable; but if the object should be
removed, by its distance or magnitude, from the immediate eye of
the master, they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant,
attached to the soil, and interested in the produce, to the mercenary
administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful, steward. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a>

The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited by
the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the occupations of
civil government, naturally resigned their leisure to the business
and amusements of private life. At Rome, commerce was always held
in contempt: but the senators, from the first age of the republic,
increased their patrimony, and multiplied their clients, by the
lucrative practice of usury; and the obselete laws were eluded, or
violated, by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties. <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a>
A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome, either
in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver
plate; and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which
contained more solid silver, than had been transported by Scipio from
vanquished Carthage. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated
their fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of
wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation. Their desires were
continually gratified by the labor of a thousand hands; of the numerous
train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of
punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants,
who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain. The ancients
were destitute of many of the conveniences of life, which have been
invented or improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of
glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern
nations of Europe, than the senators of Rome could derive from all the
refinements of pompous or sensual luxury. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> Their luxury, and their
manners, have been the subject of minute and laborious disposition:
but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of
the present work, I shall produce an authentic state of Rome and its
inhabitants, which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the
Gothic invasion. Ammianus Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital
of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of
his own times, has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively
representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant.
The judicious reader will not always approve of the asperity of censure,
the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression; he will perhaps
detect the latent prejudices, and personal resentments, which soured the
temper of Ammianus himself; but he will surely observe, with philosophic
curiosity, the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome.

<p>
"The greatness of Rome"&mdash;such is the language of the historian&mdash;"was
founded on the rare, and almost incredible, alliance of virtue and of
fortune. The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious
struggle against the tribes of Italy, the neighbors and enemies of
the rising city. In the strength and ardor of youth, she sustained
the storms of war; carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the
mountains; and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the
globe. At length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering
by the terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and
tranquillity. The venerable city, which had trampled on the necks of
the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the perpetual
guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a wise and wealthy
parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favorite sons, the care of
governing her ample patrimony. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> A secure and profound peace, such as
had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa, succeeded to the tumults of
a republic; while Rome was still adored as the queen of the earth; and
the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people, and the
majesty of the senate. But this native splendor," continues Ammianus,
"is degraded, and sullied, by the conduct of some nobles, who, unmindful
of their own dignity, and of that of their country, assume an unbounded
license of vice and folly. They contend with each other in the empty
vanity of titles and surnames; and curiously select, or invent, the most
lofty and sonorous appellations, Reburrus, or Fabunius, Pagonius,
or Tarasius, <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> which may impress the ears of the vulgar with
astonishment and respect. From a vain ambition of perpetuating their
memory, they affect to multiply their likeness, in statues of bronze and
marble; nor are they satisfied, unless those statues are covered with
plates of gold; an honorable distinction, first granted to Acilius the
consul, after he had subdued, by his arms and counsels, the power of
King Antiochus. The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying, perhaps,
the rent-roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces,
from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of
every man, who recollects, that their poor and invincible ancestors were
not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers, by the delicacy
of their food, or the splendor of their apparel. But the modern nobles
measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their
chariots, <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> and the weighty magnificence of their dress. Their long
robes of silk and purple float in the wind; and as they are agitated, by
art or accident, they occasionally discover the under garments, the rich
tunics, embroidered with the figures of various animals. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> Followed
by a train of fifty servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move
along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled
with post-horses; and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by
the matrons and ladies, whose covered carriages are continually driving
round the immense space of the city and suburbs. Whenever these persons
of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths, they assume,
on their entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate
to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the Roman
people. If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they meet
any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they express
their affection by a tender embrace; while they proudly decline the
salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not permitted to aspire
above the honor of kissing their hands, or their knees. As soon as they
have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath, they resume
their rings, and the other ensigns of their dignity, select from their
private wardrobe of the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen
persons, the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain
till their departure the same haughty demeanor; which perhaps might have
been excused in the great Marcellus, after the conquest of Syracuse.
Sometimes, indeed, these heroes undertake more arduous achievements;
they visit their estates in Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil
of servile hands, the amusements of the chase. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> If at any time,
but more especially on a hot day, they have courage to sail, in their
painted galleys, from the Lucrine Lake <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> to their elegant villas
on the seacoast of Puteoli and Cayeta, <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> they compare their own
expeditions to the marches of Caesar and Alexander. Yet should a fly
presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas; should
a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they
deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament, in affected language,
that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians, <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> the regions
of eternal darkness. In these journeys into the country, <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> the whole
body of the household marches with their master. In the same manner
as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops,
the advanced guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their
military leaders; so the domestic officers, who bear a rod, as an ensign
of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves
and attendants. The baggage and wardrobe move in the front; and are
immediately followed by a multitude of cooks, and inferior ministers,
employed in the service of the kitchens, and of the table. The main
body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the
accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians. The rear is
closed by the favorite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth,
according to the order of seniority. Their numbers and their deformity
excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate
the memory of Semiramis, for the cruel art which she invented, of
frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes
of future generations. In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction, the
nobles of Rome express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury,
and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species.
When they have called for warm water, if a slave has been tardy in his
obedience, he is instantly chastised with three hundred lashes: but
should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly
observe, that he is a worthless fellow; but that, if he repeats the
offence, he shall not escape punishment. Hospitality was formerly the
virtue of the Romans; and every stranger, who could plead either
merit or misfortune, was relieved, or rewarded by their generosity. At
present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced
to one of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the
first audience, with such warm professions, and such kind inquiries,
that he retires, enchanted with the affability of his illustrious
friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to
Rome, the active seat of manners, as well as of empire. Secure of
a favorable reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is
mortified by the discovery, that his person, his name, and his country,
are already forgotten. If he still has resolution to persevere, he
is gradually numbered in the train of dependants, and obtains the
permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty
patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship; who scarcely deigns to
remark his presence, his departure, or his return. Whenever the
rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment; <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> whenever they
celebrate, with profuse and pernicious luxury, their private banquets;
the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation. The
modest, the sober, and the learned, are seldom preferred; and the
nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have the
address to insert, in the list of invitations, the obscure names of the
most worthless of mankind. But the frequent and familiar companions
of the great, are those parasites, who practise the most useful of all
arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word, and every
action, of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble
columns and variegated pavements; and strenuously praise the pomp and
elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.
At the Roman tables, the birds, the squirrels, <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> or the fish, which
appear of an uncommon size, are contemplated with curious attention; a
pair of scales is accurately applied, to ascertain their real weight;
and, while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and
tedious repetition, notaries are summoned to attest, by an authentic
record, the truth of such a marvelous event. Another method of
introduction into the houses and society of the great, is derived from
the profession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.
The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of
friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill in the
Tesserarian art (which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables)
<a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> is a sure road to wealth and reputation. A master of that sublime
science, who in a supper, or assembly, is placed below a magistrate,
displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which Cato
might be supposed to feel, when he was refused the praetorship by
the votes of a capricious people. The acquisition of knowledge seldom
engages the curiosity of nobles, who abhor the fatigue, and disdain
the advantages, of study; and the only books which they peruse are the
Satires of Juvenal, and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius
Maximus. <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> The libraries, which they have inherited from their
fathers, are secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day.
<a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> But the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous
lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and the
harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the
palaces of Rome. In those palaces, sound is preferred to sense, and the
care of the body to that of the mind."
</p>
<p>
It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous
suspicion of a contagious malady, is of sufficient weight to excuse
the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the servants, who
are despatched to make the decent inquiries, are not suffered to return
home, till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution.
Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more
imperious passion of avarice. The prospect of gain will urge a rich
and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and
dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy;
and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans. The
art of obtaining the signature of a favorable testament, and sometimes
of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly understood; and
it has happened, that in the same house, though in different apartments,
a husband and a wife, with the laudable design of overreaching each
other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare, at the same
time, their mutual, but contradictory, intentions. The distress which
follows and chastises extravagant luxury, often reduces the great to the
use of the most humiliating expedients. When they desire to borrow, they
employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy;
but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic
declamation of the grandsons of Hercules. If the demand is repeated,
they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a
charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent creditor; who is seldom
released from prison, till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.
These vices, which degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed
with a puerile superstition, that disgraces their understanding. They
listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who pretend
to read, in the entrails of victims, the signs of future greatness and
prosperity; and there are many who do not presume either to bathe, or
to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted,

<h2>
    Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and manufactures,
the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their subsistence from the
dexterity or labor of their hands, are commonly the most prolific,
the most useful, and, in that sense, the most respectable part of the
community. But the plebeians of Rome, who disdained such sedentary and
servile arts, had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight
of debt and usury; and the husbandman, during the term of his military
service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> The
lands of Italy which had been originally divided among the families of
free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by
the avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the
republic, it was computed that only two thousand citizens were possessed
of an independent substance. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> Yet as long as the people bestowed,
by their suffrages, the honors of the state, the command of the legions,
and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious pride
alleviated in some measure, the hardships of poverty; and their wants
were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates,
who aspired to secure a venal majority in the thirty-five tribes, or
the hundred and ninety-three centuries, of Rome. But when the prodigal
commons had not only imprudently alienated the use, but the inheritance
of power, they sunk, under the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and
wretched populace, which must, in a few generations, have been
totally extinguished, if it had not been continually recruited by the
manumission of slaves, and the influx of strangers. As early as the time
of Hadrian, it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives, that the
capital had attracted the vices of the universe, and the manners of the
most opposite nations. The intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and
levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy of the Egyptians and Jews,
the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the dissolute, effeminate
prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various multitude,
which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to
despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt
beyond the precincts of the Eternal City. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a>

</p>
<p>
Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the
frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with
impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the
last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power,
embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the
poverty, and to amuse the idleness, of an innumerable people. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> I.
For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of
corn were converted into a daily allowance of bread; a great number of
ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the
appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended
the flight of steps, which had been assigned to his peculiar quarter or
division, and received, either as a gift, or at a very low price, a loaf
of bread of the weight of three pounds, for the use of his family. II.
The forest of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs,
<a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and
wholesome meat. During five months of the year, a regular allowance of
bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption
of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former
lustre, was ascertained, by an edict from Valentinian the Third, at
three millions six hundred and twenty-eight thousand pounds. <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> III.
In the manners of antiquity, the use of oil was indispensable for the
lamp, as well as for the bath; and the annual tax, which was imposed on
Africa for the benefit of Rome, amounted to the weight of three millions
of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of three hundred thousand English
gallons. IV. The anxiety of Augustus to provide the metropolis with
sufficient plenty of corn, was not extended beyond that necessary
article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamor accused the
dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued, by the grave
reformer, to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain
of thirst, since the aqueducts of Agrippa had introduced into the city
so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> This rigid
sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of
Aurelian <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> does not appear to have been executed in its full
extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms. The
administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of
honorable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of Campania was
reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.

But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude,
depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
The piety of Christian princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of
gladiators; but the Roman people still considered the Circus as their
home, their temple, and the seat of the republic. The impatient crowd
rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many
who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos. From
the morning to the evening, careless of the sun, or of the rain,
the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of four hundred
thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses
and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear, for the
success of the colors which they espoused: and the happiness of Rome
appeared to hang on the event of a race. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> The same immoderate
ardor inspired their clamors and their applause, as often as they were
entertained with the hunting of wild beasts, and the various modes of
theatrical representation. These representations in modern capitals
may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste,
and perhaps of virtue. But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans,
who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius, <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> had been
almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> and their
place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and
splendid pageantry. The pantomimes, <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> who maintained their reputation
from the age of Augustus to the sixth century, expressed, without the
use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity;
and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of
the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
The vast and magnificent theatres of Rome were filled by three thousand
female dancers, and by three thousand singers, with the masters of the
respective choruses. Such was the popular favor which they enjoyed,
that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the

discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the
inhabitants of Rome. A more rational method of inquiry might not have
been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could
easily have resolved a question so important for the Roman government,
and so interesting to succeeding ages. The births and deaths of the
citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had
condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we
might now produce some satisfactory calculation, which would destroy the
extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and
probable conjectures of philosophers. <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> The most diligent researches
have collected only the following circumstances; which, slight and
imperfect as they are, may tend, in some degree, to illustrate the
question of the populousness of ancient Rome. I. When the capital of
the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was
accurately measured, by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal
to twenty-one miles. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> It should not be forgotten that the form of
the city was almost that of a circle; the geometrical figure which is
known to contain the largest space within any given circumference. II.
The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the Augustan age, and whose
evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes,
that the innumerable habitations of the Roman people would have spread
themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want
of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and
villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising
the houses to a considerable height in the air. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> But the loftiness
of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient
materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was
repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of
private edifices within the walls of Rome, should not exceed the measure
of seventy feet from the ground. <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> III. Juvenal <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> laments, as
it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer
citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating,
without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase, in the
little towns of Italy, a cheerful commodious dwelling, at the same price
which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging. House-rent
was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous
expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but
the body of the Roman people was crowded into a narrow space; and the
different floors, and apartments, of the same house, were divided, as it
is still the custom of Paris, and other cities, among several families
of plebeians. IV. The total number of houses in the fourteen regions
of the city, is accurately stated in the description of Rome, composed
under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight thousand
three hundred and eighty-two. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> The two classes of domus and of
insuloe, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of
the capital, of every rank and condition from the marble palace of the
Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the
lofty and narrow lodging-house, where the poet Codrus and his wife were
permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the files. If we
adopt the same average, which, under similar circumstances, has
been found applicable to Paris, <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> and indifferently allow about
twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly
estimate the inhabitants of Rome at twelve hundred thousand: a number
which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire,
though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern
Europe. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> <a href="#note-7311" name="noteref-7311"><small>7311</small></a>

[ M. Dureau de la Malle (Economic Politique des Romaines,
t. i. p. 369) quotes a passage from the xvth chapter of Gibbon, in which
he estimates the population of Rome at not less than a million, and adds
(omitting any reference to this passage,) that he (Gibbon) could not
have seriously studied the question. M. Dureau de la Malle proceeds
to argue that Rome, as contained within the walls of Servius Tullius,
occupying an area only one fifth of that of Paris, could not have
contained 300,000 inhabitants; within those of Aurelian not more than
560,000, inclusive of soldiers and strangers. The suburbs, he endeavors
to show, both up to the time of Aurelian, and after his reign, were
neither so extensive, nor so populous, as generally supposed. M.
Dureau de la Malle has but imperfectly quoted the important passage
of Dionysius, that which proves that when he wrote (in the time of
Augustus) the walls of Servius no longer marked the boundary of the
city. In many places they were so built upon, that it was impossible to
trace them. There was no certain limit, where the city ended and ceased
to be the city; it stretched out to so boundless an extent into the
country. Ant. Rom. iv. 13. None of M. de la Malle's arguments appear to
me to prove, against this statement, that these irregular suburbs did
not extend so far in many parts, as to make it impossible to calculate
accurately the inhabited area of the city. Though no doubt the city, as
reconstructed by Nero, was much less closely built and with many more
open spaces for palaces, temples, and other public edifices, yet many
passages seem to prove that the laws respecting the height of houses
were not rigidly enforced. A great part of the lower especially of the
slave population, were very densely crowded, and lived, even more than
in our modern towns, in cellars and subterranean dwellings under the
public edifices. Nor do M. de la Malle's arguments, by which he would
explain the insulae insulae (of which the Notitiae Urbis give us the
number) as rows of shops, with a chamber or two within the domus,
or houses of the wealthy, satisfy me as to their soundness of their
scholarship. Some passages which he adduces directly contradict his
theory; none, as appears to me, distinctly prove it. I must adhere
to the old interpretation of the word, as chiefly dwellings for the
middling or lower classes, or clusters of tenements, often perhaps,
under the same roof. On this point, Zumpt, in the Dissertation before
quoted, entirely disagrees with M. de la Malle. Zumpt has likewise
detected the mistake of M. de la Malle as to the "canon" of corn,
mentioned in the life of Septimius Severus by Spartianus. On this canon
the French writer calculates the inhabitants of Rome at that time. But
the "canon" was not the whole supply of Rome, but that quantity which
the state required for the public granaries to supply the gratuitous
distributions to the people, and the public officers and slaves; no
doubt likewise to keep down the general price. M. Zumpt reckons the
population of Rome at 2,000,000. After careful consideration, I should
conceive the number in the text, 1,200,000, to be nearest the truth&mdash;M.

<p>
Such was the state of Rome under the reign of Honorius; at the time when
the Gothic army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
<a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently
watched the moment of an assault, Alaric encompassed the walls,
commanded the twelve principal gates, intercepted all communication
with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of
the Tyber, from which the Romans derived the surest and most plentiful
supply of provisions. The first emotions of the nobles, and of the
people, were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile Barbarian
should dare to insult the capital of the world: but their arrogance was
soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being
directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless
and innocent victim. Perhaps in the person of Serena, the Romans might
have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay, even the
adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor: but they abhorred the widow
of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale
of calumny, which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal
correspondence with the Gothic invader. Actuated, or overawed, by the
same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of his
guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death. Serena was ignominiously
strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find, that
this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of
the Barbarians, and the deliverance of the city. That unfortunate city
gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid
calamities of famine. The daily allowance of three pounds of bread was
reduced to one half, to one third, to nothing; and the price of corn
still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion. The
poorer citizens, who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life,
solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public
misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor
Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated to the use
of the indigent the princely revenue which she annually received from
the grateful successors of her husband. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> But these private and
temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a
numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces
of the senators themselves. The persons of both sexes, who had been
educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is
requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing
treasures of gold and silver, to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance
which they would formerly have rejected with disdain. The food the most
repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome
and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely
disputed, by the rage of hunger. A dark suspicion was entertained, that
some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures,
whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers, (such was the horrid
conflict of the two most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the
human breast,) even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their
slaughtered infants! <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> Many thousands of the inhabitants of Rome
expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance;
and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of
the enemy the stench, which arose from so many putrid and unburied
carcasses, infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded
and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease. The
assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly
transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported for some time, the
fainting resolution of the Romans, till at length the despair of
any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a praeternatural
deliverance. Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by
the art or fanaticism of some Tuscan diviners, that, by the mysterious
force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from
the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the
Barbarians. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> The important secret was communicated to Innocent,
the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St. Peter is accused, perhaps
without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the
rigid severity of the Christian worship. But when the question was
agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition,
that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the
authority, and in the presence, of the magistrates, the majority of
that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the
Imperial displeasure, refused to join in an act, which appeared almost
equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a>

<p>
The last resource of the Romans was in the clemency, or at least in the
moderation, of the king of the Goths. The senate, who in this emergency
assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed two ambassadors
to negotiate with the enemy. This important trust was delegated to
Basilius, a senator, of Spanish extraction, and already conspicuous in
the administration of provinces; and to John, the first tribune of the
notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business,
as well as by his former intimacy with the Gothic prince. When they were
introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty
style than became their abject condition, that the Romans were resolved
to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if Alaric
refused them a fair and honorable capitulation, he might sound his
trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised
in arms, and animated by despair. "The thicker the hay, the easier it is
mowed," was the concise reply of the Barbarian; and this rustic metaphor
was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his
contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury
before they were emaciated by famine. He then condescended to fix the
ransom, which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the
walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were
the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious
movables; and all the slaves that could prove their title to the name of
Barbarians. The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and
suppliant tone, "If such, O king, are your demands, what do you
intend to leave us?" "Your Lives!" replied the haughty conqueror: they
trembled, and retired. Yet, before they retired, a short suspension
of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate
negotiation. The stern features of Alaric were insensibly relaxed; he
abated much of the rigor of his terms; and at length consented to raise
the siege, on the immediate payment of five thousand pounds of gold,
of thirty thousand pounds of silver, of four thousand robes of silk,
of three thousand pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of three thousand
pounds weight of pepper. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> But the public treasury was exhausted; the
annual rents of the great estates in Italy and the provinces, had been
exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of
secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and
some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that
could avert the impending ruin of the city. As soon as the Romans had
satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some
measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty. Several of the gates were
cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the
adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens
resorted in crowds to the free market, which was held during three days
in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful
trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was
secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public
and private granaries. A more regular discipline than could have been
expected, was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise Barbarian
justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity
with which he chastised a party of licentious Goths, who had insulted
some Roman citizens on the road to Ostia. His army, enriched by the
contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful
province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter quarters;
and the Gothic standard became the refuge of forty thousand Barbarian
slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of
their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of
their cruel servitude. About the same time, he received a more honorable
reenforcement of Goths and Huns, whom Adolphus, <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> the brother of his
wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of
the Danube to those of the Tyber, and who had cut their way, with some
difficulty and loss, through the superior number of the Imperial troops.
A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a Barbarian with
the art and discipline of a Roman general, was at the head of a hundred
thousand fighting men; and Italy pronounced, with terror and respect,
the formidable name of Alaric. <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
At the distance of fourteen centuries, we may be satisfied with relating
the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to
investigate the motives of their political conduct. In the midst of
his apparent prosperity, Alaric was conscious, perhaps, of some secret
weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he
displayed, was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity
of the ministers of Honorius. The king of the Goths repeatedly declared,
that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace, and
of the Romans. Three senators, at his earnest request, were sent
ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of
hostages, and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals, which he
more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations, could only
inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to
the state of his fortune. The Barbarian still aspired to the rank
of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual
subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia,
Noricum, and Venetia, for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have
commanded the important communication between Italy and the Danube. If
these modest terms should be rejected, Alaric showed a disposition to
relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with
the possession of Noricum; an exhausted and impoverished country,
perpetually exposed to the inroads of the Barbarians of Germany. <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a>
But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or
interested views, of the minister Olympius. Without listening to the
salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors
under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of
honor, and too feeble for any army of defence. Six thousand Dalmatians,
the flower of the Imperial legions, were ordered to march from Ravenna
to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable
myriads of the Barbarians. These brave legionaries, encompassed and
betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens,
with a hundred soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and one of
the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law
of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty
thousand pieces of gold. Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of
impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace; and the
second embassy of the Roman senate, which derived weight and dignity
from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the
dangers of the road by a detachment of Gothic soldiers. <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a>

Olympius <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> might have continued to insult the just resentment of a
people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities;
but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace. The
favorite eunuchs transferred the government of Honorius, and the empire,
to Jovius, the Praetorian praefect; an unworthy servant, who did
not atone, by the merit of personal attachment, for the errors and
misfortunes of his administration. The exile, or escape, of the guilty
Olympius, reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced
the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power;
he fell a second time into disgrace; his ears were cut off; he expired
under the lash; and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle
to the friends of Stilicho. After the removal of Olympius, whose
character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the Pagans and
heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription, which excluded
them from the dignities of the state. The brave Gennerid, <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> a soldier
of Barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors,
had been obliged to lay aside the military belt: and though he was
repeatedly assured by the emperor himself, that laws were not made
for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial
dispensation, and persevered in honorable disgrace, till he had extorted
a general act of justice from the distress of the Roman government. The
conduct of Gennerid in the important station to which he was promoted or
restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia,
seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic. From a life
of idleness and want, his troops were soon habituated to severe exercise
and plentiful subsistence; and his private generosity often supplied the
rewards, which were denied by the avarice, or poverty, of the court of
Ravenna. The valor of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent Barbarians,
was the firmest bulwark of the Illyrian frontier; and his vigilant
care assisted the empire with a reenforcement of ten thousand Huns,
who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of
provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might
have been sufficient, not only for the march of an army, but for the
settlement of a colony. But the court and councils of Honorius still
remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny,
and demanded the heads of two generals, and of the two principal
eunuchs. The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent
on shipboard, and privately executed; while the favor of the eunuchs
procured them a mild and secure exile at Milan and Constantinople.
Eusebius the eunuch, and the Barbarian Allobich, succeeded to the
command of the bed-chamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of
these subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great
chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks, before the eyes
of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich,
in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his
life, in which Honorius discovered the faintest symptom of courage or
resentment. Yet before they fell, Eusebius and Allobich had contributed
their part to the ruin of the empire, by opposing the conclusion of a
treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal, motive,
had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls
of Rimini. During the absence of Jovius, the emperor was persuaded
to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his
situation, nor his character, could enable him to support; and a letter,
signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the
Praetorian praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the
public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honors of
Rome to the proud demands of a Barbarian. This letter was imprudently
communicated to Alaric himself; and the Goth, who in the whole
transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed, in the most
outrageous language, his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered
to his person and to his nation. The conference of Rimini was hastily
interrupted; and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was
compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions
of the court. By his advice and example, the principal officers of the
state and army were obliged to swear, that, without listening, in any
circumstances, to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere
in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic. This
rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
The ministers of Honorius were heard to declare, that, if they had only
in voked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety,
and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the
sacred head of the emperor himself; they had sworn by the sacred head of
the emperor himself; they had touched, in solemn ceremony, that august
seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would
exposethem to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion. <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a>

<p>
While the emperor and his court enjoyed, with sullen pride, the security
of the marches and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome,
almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric. Yet such was the
moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that, as he moved with
his army along the Flaminian way, he successively despatched the
bishops of the towns of Italy to reiterate his offers of peace, and
to congradulate the emperor, that he would save the city and its
inhabitants from hostile fire, and the sword of the Barbarians. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a>
These impending calamities were, however, averted, not indeed by the
wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the Gothic king;
who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
Instead of assaulting the capital, he successfully directed his efforts
against the Port of Ostia, one of the boldest and most stupendous
works of Roman magnificence. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> The accidents to which the precarious
subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a winter navigation,
and an open road, had suggested to the genius of the first Caesar the
useful design, which was executed under the reign of Claudius. The
artificial moles, which formed the narrow entrance, advanced far into
the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest
vessels securely rode at anchor within three deep and capacious basins,
which received the northern branch of the Tyber, about two miles from
the ancient colony of Ostia. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> The Roman Port insensibly swelled
to the size of an episcopal city, <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> where the corn of Africa was
deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital. As soon as
Alaric was in possession of that important place, he summoned the
city to surrender at discretion; and his demands were enforced by
the positive declaration, that a refusal, or even a delay, should be
instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines, on which the
life of the Roman people depended. The clamors of that people, and
the terror of famine, subdued the pride of the senate; they listened,
without reluctance, to the proposal of placing a new emperor on
the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the Gothic
conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as
master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of
count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus;
and the two hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of
friendship and alliance. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a>

The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the
Romans, encompassed on every side by the Gothic arms, was conducted, in
tumultuous procession, to the palace of Augustus and Trajan. After he
had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favorites and
followers, Attalus convened an assembly of the senate; before whom, in
a format and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the
majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of
Egypt and the East, which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just
contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation
was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet
sustained from the insolence of the Barbarians. But the populace,
with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters. The public
discontent was favorable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries,
oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of
countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince, who, in his
native country of Ionia, had been educated in the Pagan superstition,
and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an
Arian bishop. <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> The first days of the reign of Attalus were fair and
prosperous. An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable
body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of
Italy submitted to the terror of the Gothic powers; and though the
city of Bologna made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of
Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted,
with loud acclamations, the choice of the Roman senate. At the head of a
formidable army, Alaric conducted his royal captive almost to the gates
of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers, of Jovius,
the Praetorian praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry,
of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the first of the notaries,
was introduced, with martial pomp, into the Gothic camp. In the name of
their sovereign, they consented to acknowledge the lawful election
of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of Italy and the West
between the two emperors. Their proposals were rejected with disdain;
and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who
condescended to promise, that, if Honorius would instantly resign the
purple, he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the
peaceful exile of some remote island. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> So desperate indeed did the
situation of the son of Theodosius appear, to those who were the best
acquainted with his strength and resources, that Jovius and Valens, his
minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted
the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous
allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival. Astonished by
such examples of domestic treason, Honorius trembled at the approach of
every servant, at the arrival of every messenger. He dreaded the secret
enemies, who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bed-chamber;
and some ships lay ready in the harbor of Ravenna, to transport the
abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of
the East.

of Olympiodorus; who attributes the ungenerous proposal (which was
absolutely rejected by Attalus) to the baseness, and perhaps the
treachery, of Jovius.]
</p>
<p>
But there is a Providence (such at least was the opinion of the
historian Procopius) <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> that watches over innocence and folly; and
the pretensions of Honorius to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be
disputed. At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly
resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reenforcement of
four thousand veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna. To
these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the
factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city; and
the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension
of imminent and internal danger. The favorable intelligence which was
received from Africa suddenly changed the opinions of men, and the state
of public affairs. The troops and officers, whom Attalus had sent into
that province, were defeated and slain; and the active zeal of Heraclian
maintained his own allegiance, and that of his people. The faithful
count of Africa transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the
attachment of the Imperial guards; and his vigilance, in preventing the
exportation of corn and oil, introduced famine, tumult, and discontent,
into the walls of Rome. The failure of the African expedition was the
source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus;
and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest
of a prince, who wanted spirit to command, or docility to obey. The most
imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge, or against the
advice, of Alaric; and the obstinate refusal of the senate, to allow,
in the embarkation, the mixture even of five hundred Goths, betrayed
a suspicious and distrustful temper, which, in their situation, was
neither generous nor prudent. The resentment of the Gothic king was
exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the
rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy, by
declaring, without a blush, that he had only seemed to abandon the
service of Honorius, more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable
multitude of Romans and Barbarians, the wretched Attalus was publicly
despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were
sent by Alaric, as the pledge of peace and friendship, to the son
of Theodosius. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> The officers who returned to their duty, were
reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy
repentance was graciously allowed; but the degraded emperor of the
Romans, desirous of life, and insensible of disgrace, implored the
permission of following the Gothic camp, in the train of a haughty and
capricious Barbarian. <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a>

The degradation of Attalus removed the only real obstacle to the
conclusion of the peace; and Alaric advanced within three miles of
Ravenna, to press the irresolution of the Imperial ministers, whose
insolence soon returned with the return of fortune. His indignation was
kindled by the report, that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal
enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had
been received into the palace. At the head of three hundred followers,
that fearless Barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna;
surprised, and cut in pieces, a considerable body of Goths; reentered
the city in triumph; and was permitted to insult his adversary, by the
voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of Alaric had
forever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
<a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> The crime and folly of the court of Ravenna was expiated, a third
time, by the calamities of Rome. The king of the Goths, who no longer
dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under
the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of
relief, prepared, by a desperate resistance, to defray the ruin of their
country. But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy
of their slaves and domestics; who, either from birth or interest,
were attached to the cause of the enemy. At the hour of midnight, the
Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened
by the tremendous sound of the Gothic trumpet. Eleven hundred and
sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the Imperial city,
which had subdued and civilized so considerable a part of mankind, was
delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of Germany and Scythia.

The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a
vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of
humanity and religion. He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the
rewards of valor, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy
and effeminate people: but he exhorted them, at the same time, to spare
the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches
of the apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, as holy and inviolable
sanctuaries. Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult, several of the
Christian Goths displayed the fervor of a recent conversion; and some
instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and
perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> While the
Barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling
of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar,
was forced open by one of the powerful Goths. He immediately demanded,
though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession;
and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a
splendid hoard of massy plate, of the richest materials, and the most
curious workmanship. The Barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this
valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition,
addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the
consecrated vessels belonging to St. Peter: if you presume to touch
them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend." The Gothic
captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform
the king of the treasure which he had discovered; and received a
peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and
ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church
of the apostle. From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill, to
the distant quarter of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths,
marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected,
with glittering arms, the long train of their devout companions, who
bore aloft, on their heads, the sacred vessels of gold and silver; and
the martial shouts of the Barbarians were mingled with the sound of
religious psalmody. From all the adjacent houses, a crowd of Christians
hastened to join this edifying procession; and a multitude of fugitives,
without distinction of age, or rank, or even of sect, had the good
fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
The learned work, concerning the City of God, was professedly composed
by St. Augustin, to justify the ways of Providence in the destruction
of the Roman greatness. He celebrates, with peculiar satisfaction, this
memorable triumph of Christ; and insults his adversaries, by challenging

with the Romans, and not with the apostles. Such was the style of the
seventh century; two hundred years before, the fame and merit had been
ascribed, not to the apostles, but to Christ.]

<p>
In the sack of Rome, some rare and extraordinary examples of Barbarian
virtue have been deservedly applauded. But the holy precincts of
the Vatican, and the apostolic churches, could receive a very small
proportion of the Roman people; many thousand warriors, more especially
of the Huns, who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers
to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ; and we may suspect,
without any breach of charity or candor, that in the hour of savage
license, when every passion was inflamed, and every restraint was
removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behavior of
the Gothic Christians. The writers, the best disposed to exaggerate
their clemency, have freely confessed, that a cruel slaughter was made
of the Romans; <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> and that the streets of the city were filled
with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general
consternation. The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into
fury: and whenever the Barbarians were provoked by opposition, they
extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the
helpless. The private revenge of forty thousand slaves was exercised
without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes, which they had
formerly received, were washed away in the blood of the guilty, or
obnoxious, families. The matrons and virgins of Rome were exposed to
injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death
itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of
female virtue, for the admiration of future ages. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> A Roman lady, of
singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires
of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was
attached to the Arian heresy. Exasperated by her obstinate resistance,
he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her
neck. The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment,
and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing
efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and
gave six pieces of gold to the guards of the church, on condition that
they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband. Such
instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common. The
brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites, without consulting
either the inclination or the duties of their female captives: and a
nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, Whether those tender
victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which
they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of
virginity. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> Their were other losses indeed of a more substantial
kind, and more general concern. It cannot be presumed, that all the
Barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous
outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the
greatest part of the Roman women from the danger of a rape. But avarice
is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost
every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and
tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth. In the
pillage of Rome, a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which
contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight: but,
after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent
robbers, the palaces of Rome were rudely stripped of their splendid
and costly furniture. The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated
wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the wagons, that
always followed the march of a Gothic army. The most exquisite works
of art were roughly handled, or wantonly destroyed; many a statue was
melted for the sake of the precious materials; and many a vase, in the
division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a
battle-axe.
</p>
<p>
The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of
the rapacious Barbarians, who proceeded, by threats, by blows, and
by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden
treasure. <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> Visible splendor and expense were alleged as the proof
of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a
parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured
the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of
their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under
the lash, for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures. The edifices
of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some
injury from the violence of the Goths. At their entrance through the
Salarian gate, they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march, and
to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered
no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and
public buildings; and the ruins of the palace of Sallust <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> remained,
in the age of Justinian, a stately monument of the Gothic conflagration.
<a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> Yet a contemporary historian has observed, that fire could
scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the
strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of
ancient structures. Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout
assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of
hostile rage; and that the proud Forum of Rome, decorated with the
statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the
stroke of lightning. <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank, who
perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only
one senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy. <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> But it was
not easy to compute the multitudes, who, from an honorable station and a
prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of
captives and exiles. As the Barbarians had more occasion for money
than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their
indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of
their friends, or the charity of strangers. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> The captives, who were
regularly sold, either in open market, or by private contract, would
have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for
a citizen to lose, or to alienate. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> But as it was soon discovered
that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives; and
that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked
to murder, their useless prisoners; the civil jurisprudence had been
already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to
serve the moderate term of five years, till they had discharged by their
labor the price of their redemption. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> The nations who invaded the
Roman empire, had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry
and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of
famine. The calamities of Rome and Italy dispersed the inhabitants to
the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
While the Gothic cavalry spread terror and desolation along the
sea-coast of Campania and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium,
separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed,
or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome,
great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods
of that sequestered spot. <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> The ample patrimonies, which many
senatorian families possessed in Africa, invited them, if they had time,
and prudence, to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace
the shelter of that hospitable province. The most illustrious of these
fugitives was the noble and pious Proba, <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> the widow of the praefect
Petronius. After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject
of Rome, she had remained at the head of the Anician family, and
successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the
consulships of her three sons. When the city was besieged and taken
by the Goths, Proba supported, with Christian resignation, the loss of
immense riches; embarked in a small vessel, from whence she beheld, at
sea, the flames of her burning palace, and fled with her daughter Laeta,
and her granddaughter, the celebrated virgin, Demetrias, to the coast of
Africa. The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed
the fruits, or the price, of her estates, contributed to alleviate the
misfortunes of exile and captivity. But even the family of Proba herself
was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who
basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution, the noblest maidens of Rome to
the lust or avarice of the Syrian merchants. The Italian fugitives were
dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of Egypt and Asia, as
far as Constantinople and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlem, the
solitary residence of St. Jerom and his female converts, was crowded
with illustrious beggars of either sex, and every age, who excited the
public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune. <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> This
awful catastrophe of Rome filled the astonished empire with grief and
terror. So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin, disposed the
fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the
afflictions of the queen of cities. The clergy, who applied to recent
events the lofty metaphors of oriental prophecy, were sometimes tempted
to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the
globe.

There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the
advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times. Yet, when
the first emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the
real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced
to confess, that infant Rome had formerly received more essential
injury from the Gauls, than she had now sustained from the Goths in
her declining age. <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> The experience of eleven centuries has enabled
posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with
confidence, that the ravages of the Barbarians, whom Alaric had led
from the banks of the Danube, were less destructive than the hostilities
exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a Catholic prince, who
styled himself Emperor of the Romans. <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> The Goths evacuated the
city at the end of six days, but Rome remained above nine months in
the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some
atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine. The authority of Alaric
preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which
acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of Bourbon
had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of
the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which
consisted of three independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and
the Germans. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, the manners of
Italy exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind. They
united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of
society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and
luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of
patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the Roman pontiff,
must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
At the same aera, the Spaniards were the terror both of the Old and
New World: but their high-spirited valor was disgraced by gloomy pride,
rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty. Indefatigable in the pursuit
of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most
exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many
of the Castilians, who pillaged Rome, were familiars of the holy
inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the
conquest of Mexico The Germans were less corrupt than the Italians,
less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage, aspect
of those Tramontane warriors, often disguised a simple and merciful
disposition. But they had imbibed, in the first fervor of the
reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles of Luther. It was
their favorite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects
of Catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a
devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree, who
form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and
their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Anti-christ, to
purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.

but it was not surely the effect of fear. <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> At the head of an army
encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced
along the Appian way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying
whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the
plunder of the unresisting country. The fate of Capua, the proud and
luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its
decay, as the eighth city of the empire, <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> is buried in oblivion;
whilst the adjacent town of Nola <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> has been illustrated, on this
occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus, <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> who was successively a
consul, a monk, and a bishop. At the age of forty, he renounced the
enjoyment of wealth and honor, of society and literature, to embrace
a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy
encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who
ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a>
An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble
dwelling in one of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
Faelix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with five
large and populous churches. The remains of his fortune, and of his
understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr;
whose praise, on the day of his festival, Paulinus never failed to
celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a sixth church,
of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious
pictures, from the history of the Old and New Testament. Such assiduous
zeal secured the favor of the saint, <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> or at least of the people;
and, after fifteen years' retirement, the Roman consul was compelled to
accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested
by the Goths. During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied
that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of
their tutelar patron; yet it soon appeared by the event, that Faelix
wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he
had formerly been the shepherd. Nola was not saved from the general
devastation; <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> and the captive bishop was protected only by the
general opinion of his innocence and poverty. Above four years elapsed
from the successful invasion of Italy by the arms of Alaric, to the
voluntary retreat of the Goths under the conduct of his successor
Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over
a country, which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the
various excellences of nature and art. The prosperity, indeed, which
Italy had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually
declined with the decline of the empire.

The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the
Barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more
elegant refinements of luxury, which had been prepared for the use of
the soft and polished Italians. Each soldier, however, claimed an ample
portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine,
that was daily collected and consumed in the Gothic camp; and the
principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited
by Lucullus and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania. Their
trembling captives, the sons and daughters of Roman senators, presented,
in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of Falernian wine to the
haughty victors; who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of
plane-trees, <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays,
and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun. These delights were enhanced
by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil,
the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the Elbe
and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the Italian climate.

Whether fame, or conquest, or riches, were the object or Alaric, he
pursued that object with an indefatigable ardor, which could neither be
quelled by adversity nor satiated by success. No sooner had he reached
the extreme land of Italy, than he was attracted by the neighboring
prospect of a fertile and peaceful island. Yet even the possession
of Sicily he considered only as an intermediate step to the important
expedition, which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
The Straits of Rhegium and Messina <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> are twelve miles in length,
and, in the narrowest passage, about one mile and a half broad; and the
fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of Scylla, and the whirlpool of
Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilful mariners.
Yet as soon as the first division of the Goths had embarked, a sudden
tempest arose, which sunk, or scattered, many of the transports; their
courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole
design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed,
after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests. The ferocious
character of the Barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose
valor and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause. By the
labor of a captive multitude, they forcibly diverted the course of the
Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia. The royal
sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was
constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their
natural channel; and the secret spot, where the remains of Alaric had
been deposited, was forever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the
prisoners, who had been employed to execute the work. <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the Barbarians were
suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave
Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarch, was unanimously
elected to succeed to his throne. The character and political system
of the new king of the Goths may be best understood from his own
conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne; who afterwards, in
a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St. Jerom, in the presence
of the historian Orosius. "In the full confidence of valor and victory,
I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to
obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the
Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder
of a new empire. By repeated experiments, I was gradually convinced,
that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a
well-constituted state; and that the fierce, untractable humor of the
Goths was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil
government. From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of
glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of
future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed
the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain,
the prosperity of the Roman empire." <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> With these pacific views,
the successor of Alaric suspended the operations of war; and seriously
negotiated with the Imperial court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released
from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver Italy from the
intolerable weight of the Gothic powers; and they readily accepted their
service against the tyrants and Barbarians who infested the provinces
beyond the Alps. <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> Adolphus, assuming the character of a Roman
general, directed his march from the extremity of Campania to the
southern provinces of Gaul. His troops, either by force of agreement,
immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Thoulouse, and Bordeaux;
and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of
Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the Mediterranean to
the Ocean.
</p>
<p>
The oppressed provincials might exclaim, that the miserable remnant,
which the enemy had spared, was cruelly ravished by their pretended
allies; yet some specious colors were not wanting to palliate, or
justify the violence of the Goths. The cities of Gaul, which they
attacked, might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against
the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty, or the secret
instructions of the court, might sometimes be alleged in favor of
the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular,
unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an
appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a Barbarian host,
impatient of peace or discipline. The luxury of Italy had been less
effectual to soften the temper, than to relax the courage, of the
Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and
institutions, of civilized society. <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a>

and fragments of the times.]
</p>
<p>
The professions of Adolphus were probably sincere, and his attachment
to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a Roman
princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the Barbarian
king. Placidia, <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of
Galla, his second wife, had received a royal education in the palace of
Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with
the revolutions which agitated the Western empire under the reign of her
brother Honorius. When Rome was first invested by the arms of Alaric,
Placidia, who was then about twenty years of age, resided in the city;
and her ready consent to the death of her cousin Serena has a cruel
and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of
the action, may be aggravated, or excused, by the consideration of
her tender age. <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> The victorious Barbarians detained, either as a
hostage or a captive, <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> the sister of Honorius; but, while she was
exposed to the disgrace of following round Italy the motions of a Gothic
camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment. The
authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps
be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her
flatterers: yet the splendor of her birth, the bloom of youth,
the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuation which she
condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus;
and the Gothic king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
The ministers of Honorius rejected with disdain the proposal of an
alliance so injurious to every sentiment of Roman pride; and repeatedly
urged the restitution of Placidia, as an indispensable condition of
the treaty of peace. But the daughter of Theodosius submitted, without
reluctance, to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince,
who yielded to Alaric in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the
more attractive qualities of grace and beauty. The marriage of Adolphus
and Placidia <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a> was consummated before the Goths retired from Italy;
and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary day of their nuptials was
afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, one of the most
illustrious citizens of Narbonne in Gaul. The bride, attired and adorned
like a Roman empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of
the Goths, who assumed, on this occasion, the Roman habit, contented
himself with a less honorable seat by her side. The nuptial gift, which,
according to the custom of his nation, <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> was offered to Placidia,
consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country. Fifty
beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and one
of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious
stones of an inestimable value. Attalus, so long the sport of fortune,
and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the Hymeneal
song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful
musician. The Barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and
the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild
influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their Gothic lord.

at any time exceed the tenth part of his property. The Lombards were
somewhat more indulgent: they allowed the morgingcap immediately after
the wedding night; and this famous gift, the reward of virginity might
equal the fourth part of the husband's substance. Some cautious maidens,
indeed, were wise enough to stipulate beforehand a present, which they
were too sure of not deserving. See Montesquieu, Esprit des Loix, l.

The hundred basins of gold and gems, presented to Placidia at her
nuptial feast, formed an inconsiderable portion of the Gothic treasures;
of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history
of the successors of Adolphus. Many curious and costly ornaments of pure
gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of Narbonne, when
it was pillaged, in the sixth century, by the Franks: sixty cups, caps,
or chalices; fifteen patens, or plates, for the use of the communion;
twenty boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the Gospels: this
consecrated wealth <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> was distributed by the son of Clovis among the
churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid
some former sacrilege of the Goths. They possessed, with more security
of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of
the table, of massy gold, of the weight of five hundred pounds, and of
far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship,
and the tradition, that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician,
to Torismond, king of the Goths. One of the successors of Torismond
purchased the aid of the French monarch by the promise of this
magnificent gift. When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he
delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled
them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate
ransom of two hundred thousand pieces of gold; and preserved the
missorium, as the pride of the Gothic treasury. <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> When that
treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they
admired, and they have celebrated, another object still more remarkable;
a table of considerable size, of one single piece of solid emerald,
<a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a> encircled with three rows of fine pearls, supported by three
hundred and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the
price of five hundred thousand pieces of gold. <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a> Some portion of
the Gothic treasures might be the gift of friendship, or the tribute
of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and
rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.

secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to

regulation, the eight provinces which had been the most deeply injured,
Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and
Lucania, obtained an indulgence of five years: the ordinary tribute was
reduced to one fifth, and even that fifth was destined to restore and
support the useful institution of the public posts. By another law,
the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation, were
granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbors who should
occupy, or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors
were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of
Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary
offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects, during
the term of the public disorder and calamity A decent and respectful
attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were
encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged
by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from
the coast of Africa. The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of
the Barbarians, were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure;
and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and
surprise, that, in a single day, he had taken an account of the arrival
of fourteen thousand strangers. <a href="#note-144" name="noteref-144"><small>144</small></a> In less than seven years, the

is clogged with some difficulties; but Scaliger has deduced from
astronomical characters, that he left Rome the 24th of September and
embarked at Porto the 9th of October, A.D. 416. See Tillemont, Hist. des
Empereurs, tom, v. p. 820. In this poetical Itinerary, Rutilius (l. i.
115, &amp;c.) addresses Rome in a high strain of congratulation:&mdash;
</p>

recinge comas, &amp;c.]
</p>
<p>
This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of a
hostile armament from the country which afforded the daily subsistence
of the Roman people. Heraclian, count of Africa, who, under the most
difficult and distressful circumstances, had supported, with active
loyalty, the cause of Honorius, was tempted, in the year of his
consulship, to assume the character of a rebel, and the title of
emperor. The ports of Africa were immediately filled with the naval
forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy: and his fleet,
when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tyber, indeed surpassed the
fleets of Xerxes and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal
galley, and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible
number of three thousand two hundred. <a href="#note-146" name="noteref-146"><small>146</small></a> Yet with such an armament,
which might have subverted, or restored, the greatest empires of the
earth, the African usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on
the provinces of his rival. As he marched from the port, along the road
which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and
routed, by one of the Imperial captains; and the lord of this mighty
host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a
single ship. <a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147"><small>147</small></a> When Heraclian landed in the harbor of Carthage, he
found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had
returned to their allegiance. The rebel was beheaded in the ancient
temple of Memory his consulship was abolished: <a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148"><small>148</small></a> and the remains
of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of four thousand
pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already
defended the throne, which he afterwards shared with his feeble
sovereign. Honorius viewed, with supine indifference, the calamities
of Rome and Italy; <a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149"><small>149</small></a> but the rebellious attempts of Attalus and
Heraclian, against his personal safety, awakened, for a moment, the
torpid instinct of his nature. He was probably ignorant of the causes
and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as
Italy was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he
peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the
Alps were repeatedly vanquished in the name, and by the lieutenants,
of the son of Theodosius. <a href="#note-150" name="noteref-150"><small>150</small></a> In the course of a busy and interesting
narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince:
and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing, in this place,
that he survived the last siege of Rome about thirteen years.

<p>
The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions
of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure. His title was
acknowledged, from the wall of Antoninus to the columns of Hercules;
and, in the midst of the public disorder he shared the dominion, and
the plunder, of Gaul and Spain, with the tribes of Barbarians, whose
destructive progress was no longer checked by the Rhine or Pyrenees.
Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted, from the
court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification
of his rebellious claims Constantine engaged himself, by a solemn
promise, to deliver Italy from the Goths; advanced as far as the banks
of the Po; and after alarming, rather than assisting, his pusillanimous
ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate, with
intemperate luxury, his vain and ostentatious triumph. But this
transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of
Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals; who, during the absence of
his son Constants, a prince already invested with the Imperial purple,
had been left to command in the provinces of Spain. From some reason, of
which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem,
placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence
at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards, through the
Pyrenees, to surprise the two emperors, Constantine and Constans, before
they could prepare for their defence. The son was made prisoner at
Vienna, and immediately put to death: and the unfortunate youth had
scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family; which had
tempted, or compelled him, sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful
obscurity of the monastic life. The father maintained a siege within the
walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants, had
not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an Italian
army. The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor,
astonished the contending parties of the rebels. Gerontius, abandoned by
his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain; and rescued his name
from oblivion, by the Roman courage which appeared to animate the last
moments of his life. In the middle of the night, a great body of his
perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had
strongly barricaded. His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the
Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and
he used, with so much skill and resolution, a large magazine of darts
and arrows, that above three hundred of the assailants lost their lives
in the attempt. His slaves when all the missile weapons were spent,
fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained
by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the
soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all
sides to the house. In this fatal extremity, he complied with the
request of his Barbarian friend, and cut off his head. The wife of
Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and
disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword; and the tragic scene
was terminated by the death of the count himself, who, after three
ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger, and sheathed it in his heart.
<a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"><small>151</small></a> The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was
indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power
and abilities. The caprice of the Barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once
more seated this Imperial phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned
him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant Maximus, after he had
been shown to the people of Ravenna and Rome, was publicly executed.

[ The praises which Sozomen has bestowed on this act of
despair, appear strange and scandalous in the mouth of an ecclesiastical
historian. He observes (p. 379) that the wife of Gerontius was a
Christian; and that her death was worthy of her religion, and of
immortal fame.]
</p>
<p>
The general, (Constantius was his name,) who raised by his approach
the siege of Arles, and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born
a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the
decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire. The strength
and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general, <a href="#note-152" name="noteref-152"><small>152</small></a>
marked him, in the popular opinion, as a candidate worthy of the throne,
which he afterwards ascended. In the familiar intercourse of private
life, his manners were cheerful and engaging; nor would he sometimes
disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes
themselves, in the exercises of their ridiculous profession. But when
the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and,
bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck,
fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, Constantius
then struck terror into his foes, and inspired his soldiers with the
assurance of victory. He had received from the court of Ravenna the
important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the
West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and
anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a
more formidable enemy. Yet this interval allowed time for a successful
negotiation with the Franks and Alemanni and his ambassador, Edobic,
soon returned at the head of an army, to disturb the operations of the
siege of Arles. The Roman general, instead of expecting the attack in
his lines, boldly and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the Rhone, and to
meet the Barbarians. His measures were conducted with so much skill and
secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of Constantius in the
front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed, by
the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an
advantageous post in their rear. The remains of the army of Edobic were
preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the
field of battle to the house of a faithless friend; who too clearly
understood, that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable
and lucrative present for the Imperial general. On this occasion,
Constantius behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman. Subduing,
or suppressing, every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged
the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the
assassin of Edobic; and sternly intimated his commands, that the camp
should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch,
who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality. The usurper,
who beheld, from the walls of Arles, the ruin of his last hopes, was
tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror. He
required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the
imposition of hands, the sacred character of a Christian Presbyter, he
ventured to open the gates of the city. But he soon experienced that
the principles of honor and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary
conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of
political morality. The Roman general, indeed, refused to sully his
laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor, and
his son Julian, were sent under a strong guard into Italy; and before
they reached the palace of Ravenna, they met the ministers of death.

familiar to the Greeks of the fifth century.]
</p>
<p>
At a time when it was universally confessed, that almost every man
in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the
accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of
usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued
to arise. This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of
Spain and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been
extinguished by war and rebellion. Before Constantine resigned the
purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was
received in the Imperial camp, that Jovinus has assumed the diadem at
Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of
the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the
candidate, on whom they had bestowed the empire, advanced with a
formidable host of Barbarians, from the banks of the Rhine to those of
the Rhone. Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short
history of the reign of Jovinus. It was natural to expect, that a
brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorious army, would have
asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
The hasty retreat of Constantius might be justified by weighty reasons;
but he resigned, without a struggle, the possession of Gaul; and
Dardanus, the Praetorian praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate
who refused to yield obedience to the usurper. <a href="#note-153" name="noteref-153"><small>153</small></a> When the Goths, two
years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it
was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only
between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent
alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for
the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
Yet in a moment of disgust, (for which it is not easy to assign a cause,
or a date,) Adolphus connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and
imposed on Attalus the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty, which
ratified his own disgrace. We are again surprised to read, that, instead
of considering the Gothic alliance as the firmest support of his
throne, Jovinus upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious
importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally,
he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most
imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the
soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince, who
knew not how to reward or punish. Adolphus, educated among a race of
warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and
sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten
thousand Goths to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
He attacked Sarus at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only
by eighteen or twenty of his valiant followers. United by friendship,
animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band
of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their
enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils, <a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154"><small>154</small></a> than
he was instantly despatched. The death of Sarus dissolved the loose
alliance which Adolphus still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul. He
again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied
the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately
transmit to the palace of Ravenna the heads of the two tyrants, Jovinus
and Sebastian. The king of the Goths executed his promise without
difficulty or delay; the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal
merit, were abandoned by their Barbarian auxiliaries; and the short
opposition of Valentia was expiated by the ruin of one of the noblest
cities of Gaul. The emperor, chosen by the Roman senate, who had been
promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again
insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the Gothic king
withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from
offering any violence to the person of Attalus. The unfortunate Attalus,
who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in one of the ports
of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat: but he was
intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in
triumph through the streets of Rome or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to
the gazing multitude, on the second step of the throne of his invincible
conqueror. The same measure of punishment, with which, in the days of
his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on
Attalus himself; he was condemned, after the amputation of two fingers,
to a perpetual exile in the Isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with
the decent necessaries of life. The remainder of the reign of Honorius
was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed, that, in the space
of five years, seven usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince,
who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.

    Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians.&mdash;Part VI.
</h2>
<p>
The situation of Spain, separated, on all sides, from the enemies of
Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had
secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country;
and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a
period of four hundred years, Spain furnished very few materials to the
history of the Roman empire. The footsteps of the Barbarians, who, in
the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon
obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the
Christian aera, the cities of Emerita, or Merida, of Corduba, Seville,
Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the
Roman world. The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the
mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of
an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores
contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade. <a href="#note-155" name="noteref-155"><small>155</small></a> The arts
and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if
the character of the Spaniards was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the
hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation
from the Rhine to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of
military ardor. As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted
to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully
repelled the frequent attempts of the Barbarians. But no sooner had
the national troops been compelled to resign their post to the Honorian
bands, in the service of Constantine, than the gates of Spain were
treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the
sack of Rome by the Goths. <a href="#note-156" name="noteref-156"><small>156</small></a> The consciousness of guilt, and the
thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the Pyrenees to
desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and
the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible
violence from the frontiers of Gaul to the sea of Africa. The
misfortunes of Spain may be described in the language of its most
eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and
perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers. <a href="#note-157" name="noteref-157"><small>157</small></a> "The
irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities;
as the Barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes
of the Romans and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities
and the open country. The progress of famine reduced the miserable
inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even
the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were
exasperated, by the taste of blood, and the impatience of hunger, boldly
to attack and devour their human prey. Pestilence soon appeared, the
inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was
swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their
surviving friends. At length the Barbarians, satiated with carnage and
rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had
introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country. The
ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was
divided between the Suevi and the Vandals; the Alani were scattered over
the provinces of Carthagena and Lusitania, from the Mediterranean to the
Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of Boetica was allotted to
the Silingi, another branch of the Vandalic nation. After regulating
this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some
reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again
cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive
people. The greatest part of the Spaniards was even disposed to prefer
this new condition of poverty and barbarism, to the severe oppressions
of the Roman government; yet there were many who still asserted their
native freedom; and who refused, more especially in the mountains of
Gallicia, to submit to the Barbarian yoke." <a href="#note-158" name="noteref-158"><small>158</small></a>

The important present of the heads of Jovinus and Sebastian had approved
the friendship of Adolphus, and restored Gaul to the obedience of his
brother Honorius. Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper
of the king of the Goths. He readily accepted the proposal of turning
his victorious arms against the Barbarians of Spain; the troops of
Constantius intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul,
and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees: <a href="#note-159" name="noteref-159"><small>159</small></a> he passed
the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of
Barcelona. The fondness of Adolphus for his Roman bride, was not abated
by time or possession: and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his
illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him forever in the
interest of the republic. The loss of that infant, whose remains were
deposited in a silver coffin in one of the churches near Barcelona,
afflicted his parents; but the grief of the Gothic king was suspended
by the labors of the field; and the course of his victories was soon
interrupted by domestic treason.

He had imprudently received into his service one of the followers of
Sarus; a Barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature;
whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was
continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master. Adolphus
was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession
were violated by a tumultuous faction; <a href="#note-160" name="noteref-160"><small>160</small></a> and a stranger to the royal

But Placidia soon obtained the pleasure of revenge, and the view of
her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the
tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation. After
the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the Gothic
sceptre on Wallia; whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the
beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic. He marched
in arms from Barcelona to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the
ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world. But when he
reached the southern promontory of Spain, <a href="#note-163" name="noteref-163"><small>163</small></a> and, from the rock now
covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighboring and
fertile coast of Africa, Wallia resumed the designs of conquest, which
had been interrupted by the death of Alaric. The winds and waves
again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a
superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of
storms and shipwrecks. In this disposition the successor of Adolphus
no longer refused to listen to a Roman ambassador, whose proposals were
enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under
the conduct of the brave Constantius. A solemn treaty was stipulated and
observed; Placidia was honorably restored to her brother; six hundred
thousand measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths; <a href="#note-164" name="noteref-164"><small>164</small></a> and
Wallia engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire. A
bloody war was instantly excited among the Barbarians of Spain; and
the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their
ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the Western emperor,
exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest; the
events of which must be favorable to the Romans, by the mutual
slaughter of their common enemies. <a href="#note-165" name="noteref-165"><small>165</small></a> The Spanish war was obstinately
supported, during three campaigns, with desperate valor, and various
success; and the martial achievements of Wallia diffused through the
empire the superior renown of the Gothic hero. He exterminated the
Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province
of Boetica. He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains
of those Scythian wanderers, who escaped from the field, instead of
choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the
Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded. The Vandals
themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible
Goths. The promiscuous multitude of Barbarians, whose retreat had been
intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they
still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise
their domestic and implacable hostilities. In the pride of victory,
Wallia was faithful to his engagements: he restored his Spanish
conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the Imperial
officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their
Barbarian servitude. While the event of the war was still doubtful, the
first advantages obtained by the arms of Wallia had encouraged the court
of Ravenna to decree the honors of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
He entered Rome like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the
monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate
which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and
orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom,
and the invincible courage, of the emperor Honorius. <a href="#note-166" name="noteref-166"><small>166</small></a>

Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if
Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of
the Spanish war. His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had
passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties,
in the possession of the second Aquitain; a maritime province
between the Garonne and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical
jurisdiction of Bourdeaux. That metropolis, advantageously situated for
the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its
numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the Gauls by their wealth,
their learning, and the politeness of their manners. The adjacent
province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is
blessed with a fruitful soil, and a temperate climate; the face of the
country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths,
after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of
Aquitain. <a href="#note-167" name="noteref-167"><small>167</small></a> The Gothic limits were enlarged by the additional gift
of some neighboring dioceses; and the successors of Alaric fixed their
royal residence at Thoulouse, which included five populous quarters, or
cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls. About the same time,
in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the Goths, the Burgundians,
and the Franks, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces
of Gaul. The liberal grant of the usurper Jovinus to his Burgundian
allies, was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First,
or Upper, Germany, were ceded to those formidable Barbarians; and they
gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the two provinces
which still retain, with the titles of Duchy and County, the national
appellation of Burgundy. <a href="#note-168" name="noteref-168"><small>168</small></a> The Franks, the valiant and faithful
allies of the Roman republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders,
whom they had so bravely resisted. Treves, the capital of Gaul, was
pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony, which they so
long maintained in the district of Toxandia, in Brabant, insensibly
multiplied along the banks of the Meuse and Scheld, till their
independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower
Germany. These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence;
but the foundation of the French monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests,
the laws, and even the existence, of that hero, have been justly
arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism. <a href="#note-169" name="noteref-169"><small>169</small></a>

<p>
The ruin of the opulent provinces of Gaul may be dated from the
establishment of these Barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and
oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion,
to violate the public peace. A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on
the surviving provincials, who had escaped the calamities of war; the
fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers,
for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the
trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their
fathers. Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a
vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the Romans themselves,
not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of
civil discord. The Triumvirs proscribed eighteen of the most flourishing
colonies of Italy; and distributed their lands and houses to the
veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty
of their country. Two poets of unequal fame have deplored, in similar
circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of
Augustus appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the
Barbarians who invaded Gaul under the reign of Honorius. It was not
without the utmost difficulty that Virgil escaped from the sword of the
Centurion, who had usurped his farm in the neighborhood of Mantua;
<a href="#note-170" name="noteref-170"><small>170</small></a> but Paulinus of Bourdeaux received a sum of money from his Gothic
purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and though it
was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine
was disguised by some colors of moderation and equity. <a href="#note-171" name="noteref-171"><small>171</small></a> The odious
name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation
of the guests of the Romans; and the Barbarians of Gaul, more especially
the Goths, repeatedly declared, that they were bound to the people by
the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance
and military service. The title of Honorius and his successors, their
laws, and their civil magistrates, were still respected in the provinces
of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the Barbarian
allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority
over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honorable
rank of master-generals of the Imperial armies. <a href="#note-172" name="noteref-172"><small>172</small></a> Such was the
involuntary reverence which the Roman name still impressed on the minds
of those warriors, who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the
Capitol.

Whilst Italy was ravaged by the Goths, and a succession of feeble
tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the British island
separated itself from the body of the Roman empire. The regular forces,
which guarded that remote province, had been gradually withdrawn; and
Britain was abandoned without defence to the Saxon pirates, and
the savages of Ireland and Caledonia. The Britons, reduced to this
extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining
monarchy. They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced
in the important discovery of their own strength. <a href="#note-173" name="noteref-173"><small>173</small></a> Afflicted by
similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the Armorican
provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of Gaul
between the Seine and the Loire  
<a href="#note-174" name="noteref-174"><small>174</small></a> 
resolved to imitate the example of
the neighboring island. They expelled the Roman magistrates, who acted
under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government
was established among a people who had so long been subject to the
arbitrary will of a master. The independence of Britain and Armorica was
soon confirmed by Honorius himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and
the letters, by which he committed to the new states the care of their
own safety, might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication
of the exercise and rights of sovereignty. This interpretation was, in
some measure, justified by the event.
</p>
<p>
After the usurpers of Gaul had successively fallen, the maritime
provinces were restored to the empire. Yet their obedience was imperfect
and precarious: the vain, inconstant, rebellious disposition of the
people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; <a href="#note-175" name="noteref-175"><small>175</small></a> and
Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic,
<a href="#note-176" name="noteref-176"><small>176</small></a> was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts. Britain was
irrecoverably lost. <a href="#note-177" name="noteref-177"><small>177</small></a> But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the
independence of a remote province, the separation was not imbittered by
the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance
and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of
national friendship. <a href="#note-178" name="noteref-178"><small>178</small></a>

</p>
<p>
This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military
government; and the independent country, during a period of forty
years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the
clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns. <a href="#note-179" name="noteref-179"><small>179</small></a> I. Zosimus, who alone
has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately
observes, that the letters of Honorius were addressed to the cities
of Britain. <a href="#note-180" name="noteref-180"><small>180</small></a> Under the protection of the Romans, ninety-two
considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great
province; and, among these, thirty-three cities were distinguished above
the rest by their superior privileges and importance. <a href="#note-181" name="noteref-181"><small>181</small></a> Each of
these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a
legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy;
and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual
magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according
to the original model of the Roman constitution. <a href="#note-182" name="noteref-182"><small>182</small></a> The management of
a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and
the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty
republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the
city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves
under the standard of the magistrate. But the desire of obtaining the
advantages, and of escaping the burdens, of political society, is a
perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be
presumed, that the restoration of British freedom was exempt from
tumult and faction. The preeminence of birth and fortune must have
been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty
nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their
own servants, <a href="#note-183" name="noteref-183"><small>183</small></a> would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary
monarch.
</p>
<p>
II. The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country, was
supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and
the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted
their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective
degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of
ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighborhood of any
powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly
exercised the rights of peace and war. The gardens and villas, which
exhibited some faint imitation of Italian elegance, would soon be
converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the
adjacent country: <a href="#note-184" name="noteref-184"><small>184</small></a> the produce of the land was applied to purchase
arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants,
and of licentious followers; and the chieftain might assume, within his
own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate. Several of these British
chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more
would be tempted to adopt this honorable genealogy, and to vindicate
their hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of
the Caesars. <a href="#note-185" name="noteref-185"><small>185</small></a> Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to
affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
If the princes of Britain relapsed into barbarism, while the cities
studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must
have been gradually divided by the distinction of two national parties;
again broken into a thousand subdivisions of war and faction, by the
various provocations of interest and resentment. The public strength,
instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure
and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a
successful leader at the head of his equals, might enable him to subdue
the freedom of some neighboring cities; and to claim a rank among the
tyrants, <a href="#note-186" name="noteref-186"><small>186</small></a> who infested Britain after the dissolution of the Roman
government. III. The British church might be composed of thirty or forty
bishops, <a href="#note-187" name="noteref-187"><small>187</small></a> with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and
the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor 
<a href="#note-188" name="noteref-188"><small>188</small></a> 
would compel
them to deserve the public esteem, by a decent and exemplary behavior.
</p>
<p>
The interest, as well as the temper of the clergy, was favorable to
the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons
might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the
episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight
and authority of a national assembly.
</p>
<p>
In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously
with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of
the church, might be freely debated; differences reconciled, alliances
formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and
sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments
of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general
consent of the Britons. These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal
character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the
British clergy incessantly labored to eradicate the Pelagian heresy,
which they abhorred, as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.

it may not seem probable that he wrote from the Mss. of a Roman general,
he shows a genuine knowledge of antiquity, very extraordinary for a monk
of the fourteenth century.

It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the
revolt of Britain and Armorica should have introduced an appearance of
liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul. In a solemn edict, <a href="#note-190" name="noteref-190"><small>190</small></a>
filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which
princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor Honorius
promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the seven
provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to Aquitain and the ancient
Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their Celtic rudeness for the
useful and elegant arts of Italy. <a href="#note-191" name="noteref-191"><small>191</small></a> Arles, the seat of government
and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly; which
regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August
to the thirteenth of September, of every year. It consisted of the
Praetorian praefect of the Gauls; of seven provincial governors, one
consular, and six presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the
bishops, of about sixty cities; and of a competent, though indefinite,
number of the most honorable and opulent possessors of land, who might
justly be considered as the representatives of their country. They were
empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to
expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the
excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject
of local or national importance, that could tend to the restoration of
the peace and prosperity of the seven provinces. If such an institution,
which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been
universally established by Trajan or the Antonines, the seeds of public
wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire
of Rome. The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of
the monarch; the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been
prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these
representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended
against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen. Under the
mild and generous influence of liberty, the Roman empire might have
remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the
instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance,
its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their
vigor and independence. But in the decline of the empire, when every
principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application
of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or
salutary effects. The emperor Honorius expresses his surprise, that he
must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they
should ardently have solicited. A fine of three, or even five, pounds
of gold, was imposed on the absent representatives; who seem to have
declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and
most cruel insult of their oppressors.
